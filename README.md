# Using the NIST-CSF

## Objective

Create a detailed cybersecurity incident report using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to analyze a given network incident scenario. The goal is to demonstrate a proactive approach to security, improve communication, and enhance security practices within an organization.
 


## Scenario

A multimedia company experienced a DDoS attack that compromised its internal network. The attack was caused by an unconfigured firewall, allowing a flood of ICMP packets to overwhelm the network. To mitigate future risks, the company implemented several security measures, including firewall rules, IP address verification, network monitoring, and an IDS/IPS system. As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with creating a comprehensive security plan based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to further enhance the company's network security.
